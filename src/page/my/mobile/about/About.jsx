            people have eaten grain, grass roots, grass roots and bark. In the end, nothing can fill their stomach.
            Countless people around them leave. The old man dies, the weak child dies. The young people in the village
            don't know what to do.


            So they went to find the wise old man. The wise old man said that it was an irreverence to the gods. They
            needed to send someone to collect the smooth, spiritual, seamed, symmetrical pebbles, take one of them,
            carve it into Buddha, and let the stone Buddha protect all living beings. The villagers went to look for
            pebbles. It was very difficult to collect pebbles, climbing mountains, crossing rivers and finding the right
            one. One of the young people was there. In the process of collecting, he was hungry and hungry. The young
            man wanted to give up and lie on the stone to rest. Suddenly, he found that the stone was very smooth and
            symmetrical. It was different from other stones. Is this twin stone?


            Young people rushed to find masons, masons and stones hit a lifetime of dealings, understand the language of
            stones. Looking left and right, the Mason decided that this was what the wise old man called the twin stone.
            The Mason and the young man had great difficulty in finding the other people in the village to move the
            stone to the village temple.


            The Mason touches the twin stone with his hand and feels the spirituality and texture on the right side. Ask
            Stone, would you like to be a stone Buddha? The stone answered "Yes" to the mason, "Bang bang a few times!"
            The stone on the right said, "It's too painful. The Mason said, "It must hurt. Right Stone: In order to be a
            stone Buddha, I can bear it. Stonemason said: every chisel, you bleed blood and sweat, one day, two days,
            three days, ten days... Twenty days, just before the deadline for facial sculpture, that piece will chisel
            more painfully.


            Stonemason: Can you bear it? Right Stone: I can bear it! Bang, chisel down, and the stone cries.


            Right Stone: The pain is beyond my limit. I can't stand it. Would you slow down?


            Will you come tomorrow? The next day the Mason picked up the hammer.


            The stone on the right said, "Slow down. I thought about it all night yesterday. It was rainy and windy. I
            fell at ease. Being a Buddha is just a worship for thousands of people. People admire me. I can't stand
            it...


            The Mason was very sorry. He said to another stone, "Would you like to be a Buddha?" The stone on the left
            said: As long as it can save the people and ask for rain, the enemy and I are willing to be stone Buddhas.
            In order to carve this stone into Buddha, the Mason made it overnight, one day, two days... The stone on the
            left endured the pain of cutting with knives and axes, and the stone face was scarred. Twenty days later,
            the Mason finally carved the stone on the left into a Buddha statue.


            Two days later, when it rained heavily, the villagers came to worship the stone Buddha. They took the right
            stone as a step, trampled on their knees and worshiped. Late at night, the two stones began their dialogue.


            The stone on the right said, "We are both rocks on a mountain. I am better than you in terms of time, shape
            and opportunity." But now you are standing high and receiving people's worship. It's unfair for these people
            to step on my body to worship you and spit on me.


            Stone Buddha (the stone on the left) laughed and said, "Brother: In fact, everything is fair. I knew from
            childhood that I was not as good as you. When we were also collected down the mountain, the stone artisan
            said that we would carve you into a Buddha statue. You were afraid of pain and refused to leave a chisel on
            your body. But I wanted to bring happiness and beauty to the people. I wanted my life to be happy, so I
            accepted a thousand hammers. Bailian became a Buddha statue.

            Africa, every morning when the antelope opens its eyes, the first thing that comes to mind is that I must
            run faster than the fastest lion, or I will be eaten; and at the same time, the lion wakes up from his
            sleep, and the first thought flashes into his mind is that I must catch up with the fastest antelope, or I
            will starve to death. So, almost at the same time, the antelope and the lion jumped up and ran towards the
            sunrise.


            This is a very common phenomenon in the biosphere. Antelopes and lions are tired of running for the same
            purpose - survival. This is also the instinct of animals, and human beings are always working for one goal
            or another to pursue - conscious activities and simple instincts are important differences between human and
            animals. Animals can still run for survival, let alone humans? What people do in the world is to realize
            their own survival value, that is, to let society recognize the existence of their own value, which is
            meaningful life. Self-abandonment of flies and dogs may be able to survive, but this is not life at all! 65


            Famous physicist Cooper said: "Life is like a golf ball, you have to have a clear goal. "Yes, we can't live
            without a clear goal. Without a goal, there will be no direction and power to move forward, just like a ship
            in the sea, without a helmsman, it may run aground or run aground at any time; without a goal, people will
            live passively and do nothing. For example, a monk who strikes a bell in a temple never thinks about when he
            will lose his job or change his job. He just spends his time waiting for Nirvana to return to the west. If
            antelopes and lions can't stand up, they will inevitably be eaten or starved to death; but they always jump
            up and run forward, because they have the goal of survival, which is both direction and motivation.


            If you have a goal in mind, you must chase it and do it.</div>
